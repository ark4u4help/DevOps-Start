This is a Second and MOST IMPORTENT file you can see 
here we are going to See the basic of Infrastructre as a CODE (IasC) using terraform and 
LLM's and transformars 

AI 
-> Prepare data 
  # Acquire 
  # Filter and pre-process 
  # Versions and tag


-> Train 
The Best Open Source technology out there to simplfy the user experience.

        #MCAD
        #InstaScale

-> Validate 
   Benchmrks to Evalutate the Model Quality across a wide range of matircs 
   if passes teh threshhold
   create a Modle Card for each molde that list all the details of modle 
   in current secenrio we have many 
   Genrate a  data structre for this problem in which we have a Name , content and how this model is 
   trained  
   {  < ..  . . .  . . .  . . >  }



-> Tune
We have many modle avalailble in global Ai community 
Open AI's Model
Google Modle 
IBM Open Model they trained 
Tune Modle and get the Idal promts to use now model is specialised and ready for use 

and many more that tune the model
